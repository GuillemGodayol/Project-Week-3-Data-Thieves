## Project Description
In July 2019 Youtube changed its algorithm. We want to know if this change has had an impact in the way of content creators publish their videos.

## Questions & Hypotheses
Our questions were: 
Have the content creators changed their rithm of publishing new content? 
Have they made any changes in the video duration?
Has their income been affected?

## Dataset
We focused on Spanish top content creators, so we used web scrapping to get a list for the Top 50: ### link ###
With this information, we got more data from Youtube Data API v3

## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other?

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
We organized our work with a Trello board, setting all the tasks to do. Everyone was in charge of some of the tasks in order to work in parallel.

We organized our repository in several folders inside 'your-project'. You can find a 'Data' folder, with all the datasets we obtained, a 'Webscrapping' folder, with the files used for the webscrapping process, a 'YoutubeAPI' folder with the corresponding file and an 'Analysis' folder with the main analysis file.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
